Design of slither.io bot

-> snake that moves over a free playing field
-> food in the shape of pellets similar to pacman
-> other snakes to avoid


Input: pixel values of surrounding area ? 
		-> size of area, n pixel values
		
		Intermediate lalyers, number of layers? 
		
		Output: either buttons left, right, up  or mouse position around snake head
		
		Input size: ??
		
		Output size buttons = 3
		Output size mouse: 360 + press or 180 or 90
		
Deaeth: how to recognise game being over? How to get the length score from the screen, etc? 


Input: image processing
Output mouse locations: where is the snakes head on the screen and how big is the visible portion of playing field

Also: feedback if ?? changes, etc. 
	-> ate food = reward
	-> bump into snake = punish
	
tl;dr inputs: playfield values
	output = movement
	feedback = lenght at death
	-> restart ?? 
	
-> read information/feedback from webbroswer. What does the browser output? 
-> test different types of neural networks, different learning algorithms, different number of layers
